This is a work in progress!

```
#include <FastLED.h>

#include "platforms/esp/32/led_strip/led_strip.h"

void setup() {}
void loop() {}
```

https://github.com/espressif/idf-extra-components/tree/60c14263f3b69ac6e98ecae79beecbe5c18d5596/led_strip


And then modified so that the library component has private symbols for FastLED
(prevents linker errors if the user also includes led_strip)
